## How to Stay Safe & Secure Online: Cybersecurity Fundamentals 









## Security awareness

### Security is everyone‚Äôs responsibility.

- The internet allows an attacker to work from anywhere on the planet
- It is important for all of us to understand today‚Äôs ever-growing online threats
- take the necessary precautions to prevent a serious security issue.








### Risks caused by poor security knowledge and practice: 

- Identity Theft
- Monetary Theft
- Legal Ramifications (for yourself and your organization)
- Sanctions or termination if policies are not followed








### The top vectors for vulnerabilities available to a cyber criminal are: 

- Web Browsers
- IM Clients
- Web Applications
- Excessive User Rights







## Viruses ü¶†








### What are viruses?
- A virus attaches itself to a program, file, or disk.
- When the program is executed, the virus activates and replicates itself.
- The virus may be benign or malignant but executes its payload at some point (often upon contact).
- Viruses can cause computer crashes and loss of data.







### In order to recover or prevent virus attacks:
- Avoid potentially unreliable websites/emails.
- System Restore.
- Re-install operating system.
- Use and maintain anti-virus software.







## Social engineering üòà









### Social engineering manipulates people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term applies to the use of deception to gain information, commit fraud, or access computer systems.       
  







                       
## Phishing

### Counterfeit Emails
                       
A seemingly trustworthy entity asks for sensitive information such as SSN, credit card numbers, login IDs or passwords via e-mail.          

Also: smishing, spearphishing

<Image src={Phishing4} style={{height:"30%"}} />







<Image src={Phishing5} style={{height:"85%"}} />








## Pharming

### Counterfeit Web Pages             

A link provided in an e-mail leads to a counterfeit webpage which collects important information and submits it to the owner.
                       
The counterfeit web page looks like the real thing and extracts account information.
                       
Example: A social engineer sends an email that appears to come from a fellow employee asking the recipient to download an attachment or click on link.








## Pretext Phone Calls
                       
Example: A social engineer calls and pretends to be a fellow employee or trusted outside authority (such as law enforcement, vendor, or an auditor)








## Physical Social Engineering
    
Example: Piggybacking/Tailgating is where someone asks, ‚ÄúCan you hold the door for me? I don‚Äôt have my access card on me.‚Äù








## Other Threats üëª








## Worms

Independent programs that replicate automatically and send themselves to other computers by first taking control of certain software programs on your PC, such as email. Upon arrival, the worm may be activated to replicate.







## Logic Bombs

Malware logic that executes upon certain conditions and destroys data. The program is often used for otherwise legitimate reasons. 

Examples include:
- Software which malfunctions if maintenance fee is not paid
- Employee places logic bomb inside database to destroy data when they are terminated







## Ransomware

Ransomware is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption.







## Stalkerware

Stalkerware is monitoring software or spyware that is used for cyberstalking. Use commercial spyware to spy on their spouses or intimate partners.







## Trojan Horse

Masquerades as a benign program while quietly destroying data or damaging your system. It can be used to set up a backdoor in a computer system so that the intruder can gain access later. Example: A game that contains hidden code and sits on your computer gathering personal information without your knowledge.  









## Botnet

A number of compromised computers, called zombies, used to create and send spam or viruses or flood a network with messages as a denial of service attack.








## Man in the Middle Attack

An attacker pretends to be your final destination on the network.

When you try to connect to a specific destination, an attacker can mislead you to a different service and pretends to be that network access point or server.








## Rootkit

Upon penetrating a computer, a hacker may install a collection of programs, called a rootkit. This may enable:

Easy access for the hacker (and others) into the enterprise








## Keystroke logger                  

A rootkit also eliminates evidence of a break-in and modifies the operating system.



 



## New big scary threats üí•







## Internet of Things (IoT) leaks








## Quantum computing enabling breaking current encryption








## Deepfakes as impossible to determine realness is source of misinformation







## Web3 & metaverse scams for stealing your NFTs







## Identifying üïµüèº







## Generally Suspicious Symptoms

- Antivirus software detects a problem.
- Disk space disappears unexpectedly.
- Pop-ups suddenly appear, sometimes selling security software.
- Files or transactions appear that should not be there.
- The computer slows down to a crawl.
- Unusual messages, sounds, or displays on your monitor.
- Stolen laptop: 1 stolen every 53 seconds; 97% never recovered.
- The mouse pointer moves by itself.
- The computer spontaneously shuts down or reboots.
- Often unrecognized or ignored problems.







## Malware/Spyware Symptoms

- Changes to your browser homepage/start page.
- Ending up on a strange site when conducting a search.
- System-based firewall is turned off automatically.
- Lots of network activity while not particularly active.
- Excessive pop-up windows.
- New icons, programs, favorites which you did not add.
- Frequent firewall alerts about unknown programs when trying to access the Internet.
- Poor system performance.







## Best Practices ü§ûüèª







## Information security is



### <u>C</u>onfidentiality
### <u>I</u>ntegrity
### <u>A</u>vailability










## For your organization

- know what you have (identify the data, identify devices, identify risks)
- build up your defenses / best practices
- secure your websites
- backup
- have an incident response plan
- have a cybersecurity consultant ready to go
- reputation - protect dns, domain names, trademarks







## Data loss

- Scenario 1: Your colleague spills coffee all over his laptop moments before a big presentation.
- Scenario 2: An employee unwittingly triggers a ransomware attack.
- Scenario 3: A soon-to-be ex-employee is about to take confidential company data on the way out the door.
- Scenario 4: Lost device - phone, laptop, usb key - with important information







## Data loss

- Deleted files on Google drive - who is the owner? 
- Email is sent out with the wrong file attached containing sensitive information
- Web developer inadvertently posts private file to the public web
- Hard drive fails, phone bricks, power loss, etc, etc









## 1. Train employees in security principles

Establish basic security practices and policies for employees, such as requiring strong passwords, and establish appropriate Internet use guidelines that detail penalties for violating company cybersecurity policies. Establish rules of behavior describing how to handle and protect customer information and other vital data.








## 2. Protect information, computers, and networks from cyber attacks

Having the latest security software, browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. 

Set antivirus software to run a scan after each update. Install other key software updates as soon as they are available.

- Bitdefender, Windows Defender








## 3. Provide firewall security for your Internet connection

A firewall is a set of related programs that prevent outsiders from accessing data on a private network. 

Make sure the operating system's firewall is enabled or install free firewall software available online. 

If employees work from home, ensure that their home system(s) are protected by a firewall.








## 5. Make backup copies of important business data and information

Regularly backup the data on all computers. Critical data includes documents, spreadsheets, databases, financial files, human resources files, and accounts receivable/payable files. 

Backup data automatically in the cloud.








## 6. Control physical access to your computers and create user accounts for each employee

Prevent access or use of business computers by unauthorized individuals. 

Laptops can be particularly easy targets for theft or can be lost, so lock them up when unattended. 

Make sure a separate user account is created for each employee and require strong passwords. 

Administrative privileges should only be given to trusted IT staff and key personnel.








## 7. Secure your Wi-Fi networks

If you have a Wi-Fi network for your workplace, make sure it is secure, encrypted, and hidden. To hide your Wi-Fi network, set up your wireless access point or router, so it does not broadcast the network name, known as the Service Set Identifier (SSID). Password protect access to the router.








## 8. Employ best practices on payment cards

Work with banks or processors to ensure the most trusted and validated tools and anti-fraud services are being used. You may also have additional security obligations pursuant to agreements with your bank or processor. Isolate payment systems from other, less secure programs and don't use the same computer to process payments and surf the Internet.








## 9. Limit employee access to data and information, limit authority to install software

Do not provide any one employee with access to all data systems. Employees should only be given access to the specific data systems that they need for their jobs, and should not be able to install any software without permission.








## 10. Passwords and authentication

Implement a password policy. 







## More about Passwords

Longer passwords are better: 8 characters is a starting point.  12 characters is great. 

Do not use common or predictable passwords. Examples of bad passwords:
- your own birthday
- people‚Äôs names
- your phone number

Don't use common words: Hackers use dictionaries of words and names adding numbers and trying various capitalizations. 

Do not reuse passwords. 







## More about Passwords

The oft-cited XKCD scheme for generating passwords‚Äîstring together individual words like ‚Äúcorrect horse battery staple‚Äù ‚Äîis no longer good advice. The password crackers are on to this trick.

Take a sentence and turn it into a password: <i>I Love to work at the Impact Hub because of Liz</i>

<pre>Iluv2wrk@tIHboL</pre>

## More about Passwords

You don't need to change your password over time. This behaviour tends to lead to weaker passwords. 

Use a password generator: random unmemorable alphanumeric passwords.  Password generators will also inform you if your password is found is password lists, and may even tell you if your password has been compromised.  

Write your passwords down on a piece of paper and secure that piece of paper

If a site offers two-factor authentication, seriously consider using it. It‚Äôs almost certainly a security improvement.

Do not save your passwords in the browser.
