# Security awareness

## Security is everyone‚Äôs responsibility.

The internet allows an attacker to work from anywhere on the planet. It is important for all of us to understand today‚Äôs ever-growing online threats and take the necessary precautions to prevent a serious security issue.


Risks caused by poor security knowledge and practice: 
Identity Theft
Monetary Theft
Legal Ramifications (for yourself and your organization)
Sanctions or termination if policies are not followed


According to the SANS Institute, the top vectors for vulnerabilities available to a cyber criminal are: 
Web Browsers
IM Clients
Web Applications
Excessive User Rights

# Viruses ü¶†

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

## What are viruses? How do we avoid them?
- A virus attaches itself to a program, file, or disk.
- When the program is executed, the virus activates and replicates itself.
- The virus may be benign or malignant but executes its payload at some point (often upon contact).
- Viruses can cause computer crashes and loss of data.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

## In order to recover or prevent virus attacks:
- Avoid potentially unreliable websites/emails.
- System Restore.
- Re-install operating system.
- Use and maintain anti-virus software.

# Social engineering üòà

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >


## Social engineering manipulates people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term applies to the use of deception to gain information, commit fraud, or access computer systems.

# Phishing

## Counterfeit Emails
                       
A seemingly trustworthy entity asks for sensitive information such as SSN, credit card numbers, login IDs or passwords via e-mail.          

</Layout>

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Pharming

## Counterfeit Web Pages             

A link provided in an e-mail leads to a counterfeit webpage which collects important information and submits it to the owner.
                       
The counterfeit web page looks like the real thing and extracts account information.
                       
Example: A social engineer sends an email that appears to come from a fellow employee asking the recipient to download an attachment or click on link.

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Pretext Phone Calls
                       
Example: A social engineer calls and pretends to be a fellow employee or trusted outside authority (such as law enforcement, vendor, or an auditor)

</Layout>

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >


# Physical Social Engineering
    
Example: Piggybacking/Tailgating is where someone asks, ‚ÄúCan you hold the door for me? I don‚Äôt have my access card on me.‚Äù

# Other Threats üëª

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Worms

Independent programs that replicate automatically and send themselves to other computers by first taking control of certain software programs on your PC, such as email. Upon arrival, the worm may be activated to replicate.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Logic Bombs

Malware logic that executes upon certain conditions and destroys data. The program is often used for otherwise legitimate reasons. Examples include:
Software which malfunctions if maintenance fee is not paid
Employee places logic bomb inside database to destroy data when they are terminated

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Trojan Horse

Masquerades as a benign program while quietly destroying data or damaging your system. It can be used to set up a backdoor in a computer system so that the intruder can gain access later. Example: A game that contains hidden code and sits on your computer gathering personal information without your knowledge.  

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Botnet

A number of compromised computers, called zombies, used to create and send spam or viruses or flood a network with messages as a denial of service attack.

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Man in the Middle Attack

An attacker pretends to be your final destination on the network.

When you try to connect to a specific destination, an attacker can mislead you to a different service and pretends to be that network access point or server.

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Rootkit

Upon penetrating a computer, a hacker may install a collection of programs, called a rootkit. This may enable:

Easy access for the hacker (and others) into the enterprise

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Keystroke logger                  

A rootkit also eliminates evidence of a break-in and modifies the operating system.

# Identifying üïµüèº

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Generally Suspicious Symptoms
- Antivirus software detects a problem.
- Disk space disappears unexpectedly.
- Pop-ups suddenly appear, sometimes selling security software.
- Files or transactions appear that should not be there.
- The computer slows down to a crawl.
- Unusual messages, sounds, or displays on your monitor.
- Stolen laptop: 1 stolen every 53 seconds; 97% never recovered.
- The mouse pointer moves by itself.
- The computer spontaneously shuts down or reboots.
- Often unrecognized or ignored problems.

</Layout>

# Malware/Spyware Symptoms

- Changes to your browser homepage/start page.
- Ending up on a strange site when conducting a search.
- System-based firewall is turned off automatically.
- Lots of network activity while not particularly active.
- Excessive pop-up windows.
- New icons, programs, favorites which you did not add.
- Frequent firewall alerts about unknown programs when trying to access the Internet.
- Poor system performance.

1. Train employees in security principles
Establish basic security practices and policies for employees, such as requiring strong passwords, and establish appropriate Internet use guidelines that detail penalties for violating company cybersecurity policies. Establish rules of behavior describing how to handle and protect customer information and other vital data.

2. Protect information, computers, and networks from cyber attacks
Keep clean machines: having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. Set antivirus software to run a scan after each update. Install other key software updates as soon as they are available.

3. Provide firewall security for your Internet connection
A firewall is a set of related programs that prevent outsiders from accessing data on a private network. Make sure the operating system's firewall is enabled or install free firewall software available online. If employees work from home, ensure that their home system(s) are protected by a firewall.

5. Make backup copies of important business data and information
Regularly backup the data on all computers. Critical data includes word processing documents, electronic spreadsheets, databases, financial files, human resources files, and accounts receivable/payable files. Backup data automatically if possible, or at least weekly and store the copies either offsite or in the cloud.

6. Control physical access to your computers and create user accounts for each employee
Prevent access or use of business computers by unauthorized individuals. Laptops can be particularly easy targets for theft or can be lost, so lock them up when unattended. Make sure a separate user account is created for each employee and require strong passwords. Administrative privileges should only be given to trusted IT staff and key personnel.

7. Secure your Wi-Fi networks
If you have a Wi-Fi network for your workplace, make sure it is secure, encrypted, and hidden. To hide your Wi-Fi network, set up your wireless access point or router, so it does not broadcast the network name, known as the Service Set Identifier (SSID). Password protect access to the router.

8. Employ best practices on payment cards
Work with banks or processors to ensure the most trusted and validated tools and anti-fraud services are being used. You may also have additional security obligations pursuant to agreements with your bank or processor. Isolate payment systems from other, less secure programs and don't use the same computer to process payments and surf the Internet.

9. Limit employee access to data and information, limit authority to install software
Do not provide any one employee with access to all data systems. Employees should only be given access to the specific data systems that they need for their jobs, and should not be able to install any software without permission.

10. Passwords and authentication
Require employees to use unique passwords and change passwords every three months. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication that requires additional information beyond a password to gain entry. Check with your vendors that handle sensitive data, especially financial institutions, to see if they offer multi-factor authentication for your account.

# Passwords

Longer passwords are better: 8 characters is a starting point.  We expect 16 characters for all company-related passwords. 

Do not use common or predictable passwords. Examples of bad passwords:
your own birthday
people‚Äôs names
your phone number
Don't use common words: Hackers use dictionaries of words and names adding numbers and trying various capitalizations. 


Do not reuse passwords. 

The oft-cited XKCD scheme for generating passwords‚Äîstring together individual words like ‚Äúcorrecthorsebatterystaple‚Äù‚Äîis no longer good advice. The password crackers are on to this trick.
Do:
Use random unmemorable alphanumeric passwords (with symbols, if the site will allow them), and a password generator like the one found in Bitwarden.  This is also valuable because it will inform you if your password is found is password lists. 
Write your passwords down on a piece of paper and secure that piece of paper
If a site offers two-factor authentication, seriously consider using it. It‚Äôs almost certainly a security improvement.
