# Security awareness

## Security is everyone‚Äôs responsibility.

- The internet allows an attacker to work from anywhere on the planet
- It is important for all of us to understand today‚Äôs ever-growing online threats
- take the necessary precautions to prevent a serious security issue.

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

### Risks caused by poor security knowledge and practice: 

- Identity Theft
- Monetary Theft
- Legal Ramifications (for yourself and your organization)
- Sanctions or termination if policies are not followed

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

### The top vectors for vulnerabilities available to a cyber criminal are: 

- Web Browsers
- IM Clients
- Web Applications
- Excessive User Rights

# Viruses ü¶†

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

## What are viruses?
- A virus attaches itself to a program, file, or disk.
- When the program is executed, the virus activates and replicates itself.
- The virus may be benign or malignant but executes its payload at some point (often upon contact).
- Viruses can cause computer crashes and loss of data.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

## In order to recover or prevent virus attacks:
- Avoid potentially unreliable websites/emails.
- System Restore.
- Re-install operating system.
- Use and maintain anti-virus software.

</Layout>

# Social engineering üòà

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >


## Social engineering manipulates people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term applies to the use of deception to gain information, commit fraud, or access computer systems.

# Phishing

## Counterfeit Emails
                       
A seemingly trustworthy entity asks for sensitive information such as SSN, credit card numbers, login IDs or passwords via e-mail.          

Also: smishing, spearphishing

# Pharming

## Counterfeit Web Pages             

A link provided in an e-mail leads to a counterfeit webpage which collects important information and submits it to the owner.
                       
The counterfeit web page looks like the real thing and extracts account information.
                       
Example: A social engineer sends an email that appears to come from a fellow employee asking the recipient to download an attachment or click on link.

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Pretext Phone Calls
                       
Example: A social engineer calls and pretends to be a fellow employee or trusted outside authority (such as law enforcement, vendor, or an auditor)

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >


# Physical Social Engineering
    
Example: Piggybacking/Tailgating is where someone asks, ‚ÄúCan you hold the door for me? I don‚Äôt have my access card on me.‚Äù

# Other Threats üëª

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Worms

Independent programs that replicate automatically and send themselves to other computers by first taking control of certain software programs on your PC, such as email. Upon arrival, the worm may be activated to replicate.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Logic Bombs

Malware logic that executes upon certain conditions and destroys data. The program is often used for otherwise legitimate reasons. 

Examples include:
- Software which malfunctions if maintenance fee is not paid
- Employee places logic bomb inside database to destroy data when they are terminated

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Ransomware

Ransomware is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Stalkerware

Stalkerware is monitoring software or spyware that is used for cyberstalking. Use commercial spyware to spy on their spouses or intimate partners.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Trojan Horse

Masquerades as a benign program while quietly destroying data or damaging your system. It can be used to set up a backdoor in a computer system so that the intruder can gain access later. Example: A game that contains hidden code and sits on your computer gathering personal information without your knowledge.  

</Layout>


---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Botnet

A number of compromised computers, called zombies, used to create and send spam or viruses or flood a network with messages as a denial of service attack.

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Man in the Middle Attack

An attacker pretends to be your final destination on the network.

When you try to connect to a specific destination, an attacker can mislead you to a different service and pretends to be that network access point or server.

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Rootkit

Upon penetrating a computer, a hacker may install a collection of programs, called a rootkit. This may enable:

Easy access for the hacker (and others) into the enterprise

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# Keystroke logger                  

A rootkit also eliminates evidence of a break-in and modifies the operating system.

# Information security is

<div style={{align:"left"}}>

## <u>C</u>onfidentiality
## <u>I</u>ntegrity
## <u>A</u>vailability

</div>

</Layout>

---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light >

# For your organization

- know what you have (identify the data, identify devices, identify risks)
- build up your defenses / best practices
- secure your websites
- backup
- have an incident response plan
- have a cybersecurity consultant ready to go
- reputation - protect dns, domain names, trademarks

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={YELLOW} >

# Data loss

- Scenario 1: Your colleague spills coffee all over his laptop moments before a big presentation.
- Scenario 2: An employee unwittingly triggers a ransomware attack.
- Scenario 3: A soon-to-be ex-employee is about to take confidential company data on the way out the door.
- Scenario 4: Lost device - phone, laptop, usb key - with important information

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={YELLOW} >

# Data loss

- Deleted files on Google drive - who is the owner? 
- Email is sent out with the wrong file attached containing sensitive information
- Web developer inadvertently posts private file to the public web
- Hard drive fails, phone bricks, power loss, etc, etc

</Layout>


---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 1. Train employees in security principles

Establish basic security practices and policies for employees, such as requiring strong passwords, and establish appropriate Internet use guidelines that detail penalties for violating company cybersecurity policies. Establish rules of behavior describing how to handle and protect customer information and other vital data.

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 2. Protect information, computers, and networks from cyber attacks

Having the latest security software, browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. 

Set antivirus software to run a scan after each update. Install other key software updates as soon as they are available.


</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# Antivirus Software

- [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/) - AntiVirus, AdBlocker, VPN
- Good for home and business

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# VPN

- Protects your browsing from your ISP, work, public wifi
- Ensures a secure connection over the internet
- [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/)
- [CIRA Canadian Shield](https://www.cira.ca/cybersecurity-services/canadian-shield) - protects DNS, malware, family filter

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 3. Provide firewall security for your Internet connection

A firewall is a set of related programs that prevent outsiders from accessing data on a private network. 

Make sure the operating system's firewall is enabled or install free firewall software available online. 

If employees work from home, ensure that their home system(s) are protected by a firewall.

</Layout>

---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle >

# 5. Make backup copies of important business data and information

Regularly backup the data on all computers. Critical data includes documents, spreadsheets, databases, financial files, human resources files, and accounts receivable/payable files. 

Backup data automatically in the cloud.

How: [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/drive/)

</Layout>

---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 6. Control physical access to your computers and create user accounts for each employee

Prevent access or use of business computers by unauthorized individuals. 

Laptops can be particularly easy targets for theft or can be lost, so lock them up when unattended. 

Make sure a separate user account is created for each employee and require strong passwords. 

Administrative privileges should only be given to trusted IT staff and key personnel.

</Layout>

---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle >

# 7. Secure your Wi-Fi networks

If you have a Wi-Fi network for your workplace, make sure it is secure, encrypted, and hidden. To hide your Wi-Fi network, set up your wireless access point or router, so it does not broadcast the network name, known as the Service Set Identifier (SSID). Password protect access to the router.

Tip: Upgrade wifi at home to WPA2

</Layout>

---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 8. Employ best practices on payment cards

Work with banks or processors to ensure the most trusted and validated tools and anti-fraud services are being used. You may also have additional security obligations pursuant to agreements with your bank or processor. Isolate payment systems from other, less secure programs and don't use the same computer to process payments and surf the Internet.

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 9. Limit employee access to data and information, limit authority to install software

Do not provide any one employee with access to all data systems. Employees should only be given access to the specific data systems that they need for their jobs, and should not be able to install any software without permission.

</Layout>

---


<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle>

# 10. Passwords and authentication

Implement a password policy. 

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle >

# More about Passwords

Longer passwords are better: 8 characters is a starting point.  12 characters is great. 

Do not use common or predictable passwords. Examples of bad passwords:
- your own birthday
- people‚Äôs names
- your phone number

Don't use common words: Hackers use dictionaries of words and names adding numbers and trying various capitalizations. 

Do not reuse passwords. 

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light  >

# More about Passwords

The [oft-cited XKCD scheme](https://xkcd.com/936/) for generating passwords‚Äîstring together individual words like ‚Äúcorrect horse battery staple‚Äù ‚Äîis no longer good advice. The password crackers are on to this trick.

Take a sentence and turn it into a password: <i>I Love to work at the Impact Hub because of Liz</i>

<pre>Iluv2wrk@tIHboL</pre>

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={LIGHT_GREY} light leftTitle >

# More about Passwords

You don't need to change your password over time. This behaviour tends to lead to weaker passwords. 

Use a password generator: random unmemorable alphanumeric passwords.  Password generators will also inform you if your password is found is password lists, and may even tell you if your password has been compromised.  

Write your passwords down on a piece of paper and secure that piece of paper

If a site offers two-factor authentication, seriously consider using it. It‚Äôs almost certainly a security improvement.

Do not save your passwords in the browser. 

</Layout>

---

<Layout color={BLUE} >

# At the Hub

- Lock your screen when you get up
- Don't leave your phone sitting around
- Use a VPN 
- Be aware of people around when you're talking 
- Be aware of people walking behind you

* Applies to the coffee shop, library, or any public space

</Layout>


---

<Layout color={BLUE} >

# The Final Word Top 5 For Today

- Avoid public wifi - use VPN
- Protect against people looking over your shoulder or walking by
- Lock your computer if you get up - even at home
- Encrypt your drive
- Use a password manager
- Get AV software, VPN, ad blocker
- Know someone that can help you if you get in trouble
